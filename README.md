# Patient Risk Prediction System

The Patient Risk Prediction System is a robust Streamlit-powered web application designed to empower healthcare providers and administrators with actionable insights for proactive chronic disease management. The system facilitates data-driven decision-making by identifying at-risk patients, predicting disease progression, and optimizing resource allocation.

# Key Features:

**Comprehensive Risk Assessment:** Visualizes patient risk categories (Low, Moderate, High) and identifies high-risk populations based on age, geographical location, and medical conditions.

**Population Demographics Analysis:** Provides in-depth analysis of patient demographics including age distribution, gender, race, and city, with interactive filters for granular data exploration.

**Disease Progression & Forecasting:** Tracks and forecasts chronic disease trends over time using statistical models (e.g., ARIMA) to predict future case prevalence.

**Lifestyle Impact Analysis:** Illustrates the correlation between lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and patient risk profiles.

**Machine Learning Predictions:** Integrates machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict patient risk, highlighting significant contributing factors for targeted interventions.

**Intuitive User Interface:** Features a modular, web-based interface built with Streamlit and Python, offering dedicated pages for Risk Overview, Trends, Geography, Lifestyle Impact, and a Data Explorer.

**Dynamic Visualizations:** Employs a variety of interactive charts and graphs (bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, KPI cards, maps) using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, optimized for both high-level dashboards and detailed analyses.

# Technical Stack:

**Programming Language:** Python
**Web Framework: **Streamlit
**Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
**Data Visualization: **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair
**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, StandardScaler)
**Time Series Analysis:** Statsmodels (ARIMA)
**Database Interaction (Conceptual):** SQL (for data extraction and validation)
**Business Intelligence Tool (Conceptual): **Power BI (for effective visual creation)

# Data Requirements: 
The application is designed to operate with structured healthcare datasets, typically provided in CSV format. These include:

**patients.csv: **Contains core patient demographic information.
**conditions.csv:** Records medical conditions and diagnoses.
**observations.csv:** Stores clinical observations and measurements (e.g., vital signs, lab results).
**encounters.csv:** Details hospital visits and patient encounters.
